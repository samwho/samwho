### ðŸ‘‹ Hi

I'm Sam. Husband, dad, programmer, whisky-drinker, writer. I love video games, lie-ins, cold weather, and being indoors. I buy more books than I read, I'm scared of spiders and wasps, and I put ice in my whisky.

It's really nice to meet you.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

During the day I am a developer educator for [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

During the evenings and weekends, I'm usually writing visual introductions to programming concepts at
