### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam. Husband, dad, programmer, whisky-drinker, infrequent writer. I love video games, lie-ins, cold weather, and being indoors. I buy more books than I read, I'm scared of spiders and wasps, and I put lots of ice in my whisky.

It's really nice to meet you.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

During the day, I'm the Lead Engineer, [Nebula](https://nebula.app) API team for [@standardbroadcast][1].
During the evenings and weekends, when I'm not spending time with family
you'll find me either gaming or tinkering with side projects, often at
<https://twitch.tv/samwhoo>.

Once in a blue moon I do some writing, which you can find an archive of at
<https://samwho.dev/blog/>.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me

I'm quite open to email, provided you aren't trying to sell me something.
My email address is [hello@samwho.dev](mailto:hello@samwho.dev).
